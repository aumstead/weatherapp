Notes

I spent way more than an hour doing this. The biggest time sink was probably getting a service set up for the weather, rather than just newing-up an http client instance in a controller.

I also spent a lot of time fiddling with the response. I actually haven't had to make many API calls at my current job, so I'm not accustomed to seeing the data come in and requiring all the conversions. I'm sure I made some mistakes. Using the bracket syntax to read the json is a null reference exception waiting to happen. In fact, there are probably quite a few places where I need null checks.

I barely spent any time on the frontend. I'd direct you to my website andrewumstead.com to see how meticulous I can be with CSS and JS.

Thanks!
